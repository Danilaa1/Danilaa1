<details>

My fascination with computers began in childhood, driven by a relentless curiosity about how the digital world worked. I often wondered how platforms like YouTube, Google, and triple-A games were built. This curiosity sparked my journey into the realm of programming.

I started with Python, crafting simple programs such as calculators and games. One of my early projects was a small search engine using Google's API. However, Python and I eventually parted ways as I discovered my true passion for Java. With guidance from my uncle, a Java enthusiast, I delved into web development and software programming. One of my proudest achievements was developing a racing game with realistic car physics and a custom server architecture in Minecraft. This included creating APIs, custom commands, rank systems, and cosmetics.

Despite my success in backend development, my enthusiasm shifted when I discovered front-end development. The ability to see immediate changes on a website with just a single line of code captivated me. I immersed myself in HTML, CSS/SCSS, and advanced technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. My passion for front-end development grew as I explored motion and animation with tools like GSAP and Framer Motion.

Today, I continue to be inspired and driven by the dynamic and creative world of front-end development. My journey has taught me the importance of exploring new technologies and continually expanding my knowledge. To anyone on a similar path, I advise you to embrace new challenges, find your passion, and let it guide your learning.

# Snap Card Game

A Snap card game implemented in TypeScript. This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple card game, Snap, where players take turns playing cards and call out "Snap!" when they notice matching cards.

## Description

The Snap card game involves players taking turns to play cards from their hands. If the card played matches the card on the table (based on specified rules), the player calls "Snap!" and collects the cards. The game continues until a player has no cards left or a specified number of rounds have been played. The player with the most cards at the end wins.

## Rules of the Game

- The cards are split evenly among the players.
- Each player, in turn, places a card on the table.
- If a player's card matches the top card on the table (based on the game variation), they call "Snap!" and collect the cards on the table.
- The game ends when a player has no cards left or after a set number of rounds.
- The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

   cd snap-card-game-ts
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
    ```

3. **Install TypeScript (if not already installed)**:
   ```sh
   npm install -g typescript
    ```

4. **Compile the TypeScript files**:
   ```sh
   npx tsc
   ```

## Usage

To play the Snap card game, run the following command:

```sh
npm start
```
