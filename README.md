<summary><h3>Daniel's Coding Story</h3>
My fascination with computers began in childhood, driven by a relentless curiosity about how the digital world worked. I often wondered how platforms like YouTube, Google, and triple-A games were built. This curiosity sparked my journey into the realm of programming.

I started with Python, crafting simple programs such as calculators and games. One of my early projects was a small search engine using Google's API. However, Python and I eventually parted ways as I discovered my true passion for Java. With guidance from my uncle, a Java enthusiast, I delved into web development and software programming. One of my proudest achievements was developing a racing game with realistic car physics and a custom server architecture in Minecraft. This included creating APIs, custom commands, rank systems, and cosmetics.

Despite my success in backend development, my enthusiasm shifted when I discovered front-end development. The ability to see immediate changes on a website with just a single line of code captivated me. I immersed myself in HTML, CSS/SCSS, and advanced technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, and React. My passion for front-end development grew as I explored motion and animation with tools like GSAP and Framer Motion.

Today, I continue to be inspired and driven by the dynamic and creative world of front-end development. My journey has taught me the importance of exploring new technologies and continually expanding my knowledge. To anyone on a similar path, I advise you to embrace new challenges, find your passion, and let it guide your learning.
