# <span style="color:#0078ff;">Daniel White</span>  
**`Mid-Level Front-End Engineer`** · Derby, UK · Open to UK/Europe Remote

I build **fast, testable, and user-focused web applications** with **React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS**, and **Motion (Framer Motion)**.  
Over the past **3+ years**, I’ve shipped production features end-to-end — from component architecture and API integration to testing, performance tuning, and deployment.

### 🚀 Impact Highlights
- Rebuilt a full front-end in **Next.js**, reducing load times by **35%**
- Shipped a **personalised quote engine**, supporting a **60% sales increase**
- Built an internal **AI-driven deck plan tool** to extract structured data from cruise ship layouts, reducing manual work and improving accuracy
- Strong experience in **payments/checkout flows**, with a focus on UX, reliability, and measurable outcomes

## 🧩 What I’m Building Now: Cloudy Inspector (Browser Extension)

**Cloudy Inspector** is a developer-focused Chrome extension that helps you inspect UI faster and convert real DOM into reusable components.

### ✅ Core Capabilities
- Hover/inspect elements and extract **class names + HTML**
- Copy clean snippets to clipboard (tailored for UI work)
- Save component candidates locally for later refactor
- Smooth UI transitions using **Motion (Framer Motion v12)**

### 🗺️ Roadmap
- Component library generation (React/Vue)
- “Explain this UI” + AI refactor suggestions
- Context capture (DOM + styles) → **AI-assisted component conversion**
---

## 🧠 Core Stack

### Front-End
- **React** · **Next.js** · **TypeScript** · **Tailwind CSS**
- **Motion / Framer Motion** (micro-interactions + polished UX)
- UI/UX collaboration, design handoff execution, component systems

### Back-End & Platform (working knowledge / used in projects)
- **Node.js** · **REST APIs** · **SQL (Postgres)**
- **Docker** · **Git** · CI basics · AWS exposure

### Quality
- Testing mindset: unit + integration where it matters  
- Tools: **Jira** · Git workflows · (JUnit exposure via team environments)

## 📌 Featured Work

### 🔍 Cloudy Inspector — Browser Extension (Plasmo + React + TS + Motion)
A visual dev-tooling extension to inspect elements, extract classes/HTML, and streamline component reuse.  
**Why it matters:** less time digging through DOM/CSS and more time building consistent UI.

---

### 🛳️ Cruise Deck Plan Detection Tool
An internal tool turning deck plan visuals into structured data to improve accuracy and reduce manual effort.  
**Tech:** Canvas / Node.js / OCR pipeline  
**Outcome:** faster data extraction + fewer errors

---

## ✅ What You Can Expect Working With Me
- Clean, reusable component architecture (scale-friendly)
- Performance thinking (render pipeline, bundle hygiene, UX polish)
- Practical testing + strong edge-case awareness
- Ownership mindset: ship → measure → iterate
- Comfortable collaborating with product/design and mentoring where helpful

---

## 📈 Currently Exploring
- AI-assisted UI workflows (DOM → component generation)
- Better motion systems (delight without jank)
- Extension architecture patterns + scalable state/data capture
